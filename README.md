### Objective

The goal of this project is to design a basic interactive sales dashboard that summarizes sales performance by product, region, and month.

This dashboard provides key insights to business users through clear data visualization.

### Tools Used

Power BI – for dashboard creation

CSV Dataset (Superstore Sales) – containing columns:

Order Date

Region

Category

Sub-Category

Sales

Profit

### Dataset

Sample dataset: Superstore_Sales.csv
(Any sales dataset with the above fields can be used.)

### Steps Followed

Imported the CSV file into Power BI.

Converted Order Date into Month-Year format for trend analysis.

### Added visuals:

📈 Line Chart: Sales over Months

📊 Bar Chart: Sales by Region

🍩 Donut Chart: Sales by Category

📊 Bar Chart: Sales by Sub-Category

### Added a Slicer for Region to filter across visuals.

Applied consistent colors to highlight top-performing categories/regions.
